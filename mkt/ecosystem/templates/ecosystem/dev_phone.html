              Firefox OS is a new mobile operating system built entirely using open web standards. In Firefox OS,
               HTML5 apps can directly control phone hardware and key functionality — for example making the phone
                vibrate, making phone calls, and sending text messages.

              We believe that developers will be truly instrumental in bringing the power of the web to mobile, so
               we have worked with various partners to make devices available for developing and testing apps, and 
               learning more about customizing Firefox OS itself. This page provides useful information to developers, 
               such as links to developer documentation, available devices, and where to obtain them.

              Mozilla, Geeksphone, and Telefónica worked together to create the Geeksphone Keon and Peak, respectively
               low-end and higher-end preview phones for developers wanting to start developing on real Firefox OS 
               devices. Note that no more phones are being produced at this moment in time, although another run is 
               planned for the future. A number will remain in circulation however, and these devices are still very 
               valid for developer testing, having full updates available to them.

              If you already have a Firefox OS device and want some guidance and direction, you can 
              <a href="{{ devhub_url }}">get started at the Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub</a>. The 
              <a href="{{ mdn_url }}">Mozilla Developer Network</a> also provides a wealth of useful resources such as 
              API documentation, and further information on Open Web App development.

              If you don't have a Firefox OS device, explore the other tabs to find out how to obtain one. You don't 
              have to wait however — you can start developing and testing Firefox OS Apps right away using the 
              <a href="{{ simulator_url }}">Firefox OS simulator</a>.

              When developing for a nascent platform, useful sources of information are always more difficult to find 
              than for more established platforms. To give Firefox OS developers as much help as possible, we'd like 
              you to get involved with the effort! We would like to invite you to add any useful information you have 
              to the <a href="{{mdn_url}}">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. You can edit pages after creating a Mozilla 
              Persona user account and logging in.
